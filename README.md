# codecrafters-http-continued
A continuation of my solution to the CodeCrafters HTTP Server Challenge written in Go.

[CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io) is a learning platform geared at programmers beyond the beginner stage (in their words, 'seasoned developers'), focusing on learning by doing through what they call "challanges". In these challenges you are lightly guided through building simple replications of common software products/tools (such as git, redos etc). It is far from just another tutorial site - I highly recommend trying them out!

The first commit (asside from the initial one from GH) is an import of my solution to the [Build your own HTTP Server](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/introduction) challenge. I have ommitted the test running script and other platform specific files. The code was written in a fairly 'just get it done' fashion though I did a bit of a refactor halfway through the challange for extensability. Although this code is the _completion_ of the challenge, I am using it as a starting point for further education. My main learning objectives are the Go language and a deeper understanding of the HTTP protocol (yes I know the 'P' stands for protocol, I toyed with just saying 'HTT Protocol' but it didn't look right...)
